# CancerTrace
CancerTrace is a computational framework designed to identify cancer driver genes and their upstream regulators from longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. By integrating patient-specific, time-resolved data, CancerTrace enables dynamic mapping of gene regulatory networks

## Features
- 🔎 Identify cancer-originating clusters from scRNA-seq data  
- 🧬 Reconstruct time-resolved GRNs using **Transfer Entropy** + **Sparse Precision Matrix Inference**  
- 📊 Quantify causal influence of non-driver → driver genes with **Bayesian Logistic Modeling**  
- 🛠 Variational Bayesian inference ensures robust predictions  
- 📈 Rank both known and novel driver genes across multiple tumor stages  
- 🌐 Reveal upstream modulators and regulatory hierarchies in tumor progression
