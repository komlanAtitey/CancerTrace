# CancerTrace
CancerTrace is a computational framework designed to identify cancer driver genes and their upstream regulators from longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. By integrating patient-specific, time-resolved data, CancerTrace enables dynamic mapping of gene regulatory networks
